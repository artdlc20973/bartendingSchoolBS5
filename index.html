      <p>A bartender (also known as a barkeep, barman, barmaid, or a mixologist) is a person who formulates and serves alcoholic or soft drink beverages behind the bar, usually in a licensed establishment. Bartenders also usually maintain the supplies and inventory for the bar. A bartender can generally mix classic cocktails such as a Cosmopolitan, Manhattan, Old Fashioned, and Mojito.</p>
      <p>Bartenders are also responsible for confirming that customers meet the legal drinking age requirements before serving them alcoholic beverages. In certain countries, such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Sweden, bartenders are legally required to refuse more alcohol to drunk customers.</p>
      <p class="media pb-5">The bartending profession was generally a second occupation, used as transitional work for students to gain customer experience or to save money for university fees.[5] The reason for this is because bartenders in tipping countries such as Canada and the United States, can make significant money from their tips.[6] This view of bartending as a career is changing around the world, however, and bartending has become a profession by choice rather than necessity. It includes specialized education â€” European Bartender School operates in 25 countries.</p>
